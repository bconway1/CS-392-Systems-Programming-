# CS-392-Systems-Programming-
Programming assignments, quizzes and tests

Assignment_1
  
  -Implement a simplified version of the “cat” shell command, which reads contents sequentially from the input file and prints the data to    the standard output.
  
  -You are given a file with a sequence of unsorted integers. These integers are saved in the format of strings (strings of digits) and     each line represents one integer (maximal value 4294967296). After reading those strings, your programs needs to transform them into       integers (transfer each string into an integer which can be saved in a variable of type “int”), sort those integers, and save them to     another file in the format of binary (save the four-byte memory of an integer to the file). Each integer should take one line in the       output file.
  
Assignment_2
  
  -Implement a shared library libcs392string.so, which provides the APIs for memory copy and string length calculation.
  
Midterm
  
  -Implement a shared library libcs392_midterm.so, which provides the APIs for cs392_strcpy, cs392_strcmp, and cs392_strncat.
  
Makefile_example
  
  -Please create a Makefile to compile this program to "prog".
